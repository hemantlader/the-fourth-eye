# THEFOUTHEYE-SMARTHOME-SURVEILLANCESYSTEM

This Raspberry Pi based Smart Surveillance System presents the idea of
monitoring a particular place in a remote area. The proposed solution offers a cost
effective ubiquitous surveillance solution, efficient and easy to implement.
This project will also present the idea of motion detection and tracking using
image processing. This type of technology is of great importance when it comes to
surveillance and security. Live video streams will therefore be used to show how
objects can be detected then tracked. The detection and tracking process will be based
on pixel threshold.

We can even add more than one authorized person to whom the message will
be forwarded. The database is maintained with the help of google firebase. We can
even extend the project by adding more modules for providing more security.
This surveillance system can be used from anywhere in the world either by
using mobile application designed in Flutter or by accessing web portal.

We can automate our home through IOT, which means we can able to control
our appliances, devices and electrical switches from anywhere. Also all the detected
images can be accessed through web portal or mobile application. These images are
stored in Firebase Storage which is cloud storage.

Mobile application is built in flutter, which allows to develop applications for
Android and iOS both with single codebase.

We built a Home Security System using
Raspberry PI Camera. This system will detect the presence of Intruder and quickly
alert the user by sending him a alert mail. This mail will also contain the Picture of
the Intruder, captured by Pi camera. Raspberry Pi is used to control the whole system.
This system can be installed at the main door of your home or office and you can
monitor it from anywhere in the world using your Email over internet
